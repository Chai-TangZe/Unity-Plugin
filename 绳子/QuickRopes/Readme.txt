Documentation:
Documentation has been included in the form of PDF. You can find this file in the QuickRopes folder under "Documentation".

For more up to date documentation and to check if there are any new revisions go to the online documentation page by typing picogames.com/quickropes-documentation/ in your browsers URL bar.

Quick Start:
All menu items are located under the 'GameObject -> 3D Object -> QuickRopes" dropdown.

To create your first rope simply go to the dropdown above and click "Create: Chain At Origin"

Connecting rigidbodies to the rope is done through the same method as is done with any rigidbody and joint in Unity. Expand the rope and select the joint you wish to attach to. Simply drag that joints gameobject onto the joints connected body parameter to complete the connection.

A popular feature has been the ability to 'raise' and 'lower' your rope. There is a script in the "_Example/Scripts/" folder called "RopeController". Please refer to that for a good example on how to accomplish raising and lowering your ropes in version 3.
